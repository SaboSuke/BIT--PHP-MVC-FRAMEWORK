# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to BIT! We appreciate any contributions,
large or small. If you've contributed to BIT we would recommend that
you add yourself to the list of contributors, found in [CONTRIBUTORS.md].

To do this, after you've set up the development environment, run:

```
yarn all-contributors
```

### Documentation

Note that the documentation isn't generated yet. Nevertheless, it will be online soon as we're working on it.


## Are there other ways of contributing?

Absolutely! Try any of the following areas:

### Suggest or Improve a documentation

If there's something in our documentation that you think needs spell checking, clearing up, additional code examples, or could be made better in some way, help us by opening an issue detailing the problem.

### Improve our issues

Issues are like a secondary means of documenting the project, and in cases where an issue is missing reproduction steps, please help us by co-ordinating with the original author to find out more details about their problem.

### Send feedback on issues

Feedback on issues is very important and will shape the direction of BIT.
Please help us by leaving constructive criticism on issues that matter to you.
Note that we don't find "+1" comments to be very helpful; instead, use GitHub
reactions and subscribe to the thread to be notified of any progress. This helps to keep our discourse focused on the topic at hand.


### Review pull requests

It's really important to get more eyes on upcoming features and fixes. Please help by reviewing pull requests; even leaving a thumbs up reaction is better than nothing at all. 
Helping us to review means less time is wasted by all of us if a buggy release is cut.


### Talk with us!

You can contact us on ```abedissam95@gmail.com``` where you can ask questions or discuss features;
Feel free to ask any questions of your own!

## How you can support us

If you don't have time to contribute to the project directly, you can also
help us out by starring the repository. Word of mouth really does mean a lot to us!
